FIX ERROR

1) HANDLE DELETION CORRECTLY VIA BACKEND & FRONTEND:
    Behaviour to be achived: Delete eg. Garnet<Rice> and all plates with this garnet should be transfered to Garnet<NULL>.
    Prevent user from deleting <NULL> garnet.
    On CATEGORIES create a null (fallback) category and prevent user from deleting it. Also hide it from menu and make it impossible to show
    Repeat logic from garnets.

2) CORRECT SPECIAL PLATES ON MENU POP UP! ADD DESC + GARNET TO SHOW!
